               <h2>Learning the Basics</h2>
               <p>When starting off Dragon ball Fighter Z, I was clueless on how the game worked. I had to learn the basic mechanics of the game. I had to learn what buttons corresponded to which attacks, and what the D-Pad notation was.</p>

               <h2>Learning to do basic combos</h2>
               <p>After learning the basics of the game, I started to learn basic combos. By pressing the light attack button three times, it gives you a basic auto combo. By pressing the medium attack button it would give you an automated combo with a different type of attack at the end, which I had yet to learn what it was. This was the next step in my Dragon Ball Fighter Z journey, learning what that attack was.</p>

               <h2>Learning to do super attacks</h2>
               <p>After doing the automated medium combo, I opened the special attack list that is character specific. I learned that if you use the analog stick to do a half circle forward or back, and then pressed right bumper or right trigger, it would do a super or ultimate attack.</p>

               <h2>Learning to do block strings</h2>
               <p>Once I reached the point of needing to learn blockstrings, I was further along in my journey. Block strings are combos of buttons and abilites to use while your opponent is blocking. If you do them correctly, your opponent will not be able to react, and if they try to they will be hit by one of the attacks in the block string</p>

               <h2>Learning to do advanced combos</h2>
               <p>Advanced combos are the bread and butter to this game, without knowing how to do them, you will most likely lose every game like I did until I learned them. Advanced combos are character specific, you must learn them for whichever characters you intend to use. It is important to learn the timing to string these combos together. You can look for guide videos on YouTube to help you learn them. The most basic advanced combo is called a "BNB". A BNB is essentially the most simple form of an advanced combo, but does a lot more damage than an auto combo.</p>

               <h2>Picking a team</h2>
               <p>Picking a team that can work well together is important. Each character can do an assist attack to help the current fighting character; therefore, picking your team based on assists is important. Some characters assists work well while other characters are fighting and some don't. There are three types of assists, an A, B, and C assist. C is the most popular because it is almost the same for every character. Picking your team can make or break you!</p>
